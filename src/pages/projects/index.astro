One of our all time favorite podcast friends, Prashanth Rao, joins us to dig into this topic beyond the hype. Prashanth gives us a bit of background and practical use cases for GraphRAG and graph data.',

        description: 'This talk presents Kùzu: a new open-sourced graph database management system (GDBMS) that is designed for graph data science (GDS) eco-system, specifically in Python. GDS applications require a series of data processing steps, such as extracting data from tabular sources into a graph of nodes and relationships, cleaning and transforming the graph, extracting node features, and finally moving data into a GDS package, such as NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric for graph analytics. These steps can be performed easily and efficiently by GDBMSs, which provide high-level graph-based data models and query languages to developers. Kùzu is a GDBMS designed to serve as an essential storage system for GDS developers.',

We thought it would be timely and practical to have someone on the show that has been hands on with the various options and actually tried to build applications leveraging vector search. Prashanth Rao is a real practitioner that has spent and huge amount of time exploring the expanding set of vector database offerings. After introducing vector database and giving us a mental model of how they fit in with other datastores, Prashanth digs into the trade offs as related to indices, hosting options, embedding vs. query optimization, and more.',
