    I'm an AI and data engineer who's passionate about building intelligent, automated applications using a range
    of databases, tools and frameworks. My primary interests include database systems, knowledge graphs,
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

    I'm currently based in Toronto 🇨🇦, and have previously lived in Vancouver 🇨🇦, London 🇬🇧 and Ann Arbor,
    Michigan 🇺🇸. I love writing technical content and digging into the internals of tools and
    frameworks, typically in Python 🐍 and Rust 🦀. I'm also a big fan of open source software and open
    knowledge-sharing, in person and through this blog.
